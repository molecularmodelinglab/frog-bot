# frog-bot

There was once a member of the molecular modeling lab that just loved frogs. 
So it only made sense that the lab slack had a bot that loved frogs as much 
as he did.
A so, `frog-bot` was born

## Install
Just clone the repo and install requirements. I tested for python 3.11, not sure if it runs with other versions.
```
git clone git@github.com:molecularmodelinglab/frog-bot.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to have the `fortune` command installed (so the bot currently only support unix systems)
```
sudo apt install fortune
```

To run you need just need to run `main.py`, which will start the bot.
You will also need to set up something that allows slack to route requests
to you bot. 
I just used [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and had it route traffic to my app.
Not very secure or production worthy but it works and this is a frog bot.

You will also need to set the environment variables `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_SIGNATURE` to the correct 
tokens for your bot (you can get them from the bot admin page via slack)

The bot currently requires subscriptions to the `app_mention` and `message.channels` events.
It will also need the following permissions
- `app_meantions:read`
- `chat:write`
- `commands`
- `files.write`
- `incoming-webhook`
- `reactions.write`
  
## Functionality
Rigth now `frog-bot` does a few things.

### Daily frog images
Every day, at 9am the frog bot will post a frog image to the 'frog-of-the-day' channel.
It also include a random quote generated by fortune. Right now it will pick any quote
even the "offensive" ones (that what the docs say), but you can change that command
yourself if you want.
As and example our bot has done this before:

![Example Frog](https://github.com/molecularmodelinglab/frog-bot/blob/main/example-daily-frog.jpg)

![Example Frog2](https://github.com/molecularmodelinglab/frog-bot/blob/main/frog-bot-example2.png)

> [!WARNING]
> You will need to configure this to your desired channel-id, which is hard coded in `main.py`

### Reacting to the word 'frog'
`frog-bot` with react with :frog: to any message that contains the word "frog" in it 
(if the bot is in that channel)

### `/frog` command
The `/frog` command will have the frog bot send a frog image to the channel with a cute message

### App mentions
Whenever you `@frog-bot`, the bot will reply with a random number of ribbits
(just like a real frog!)

## Contributing
I love frogs. If you love frog feel free to add new frog images or new frog related function for the
frog bot. Just make a pull request with your changes
